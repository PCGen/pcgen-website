        <h1>A sad week for gaming</h1>
        <p>
        	On behalf of the PCGen team and the community at large the PCGen BoD would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Gary Gygax's family and 		
            friends.  Simply put, our community would never have come into being with out the work that Gary and Dave started, so thanks for inspiring us to 
            explore our imaginations Gary!  You will be sorely missed :(.
        </p>

        <p>PCGen is a Java-based RPG character generator and maintenance program (d20 Systems mainly) that works on most personal computers (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, etc.). All datafiles are ASCII so they can be modified by users. All of this work is performed under the watchful gaze of the PCGen <a href="http://www.pcgen-test.org/wiki/index.php?title=Board_of_Directors">Board Of Directors</a>.</p>
